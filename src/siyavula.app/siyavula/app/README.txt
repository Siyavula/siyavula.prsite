Notes:

There is no individual book page. The books are just listed on a single page, with applicable links.

The book list at the bottom shows the books in the order that they are in the books folder, 4 books maximum. Did you have something else in mind?

In most cases, the images that you upload will only be resized, not cropped. This is easy to change. We probably need to discuss.

Known Issues/To be done:

The background on the header banner text is solid, not transparent.

The extra areas on the header banner for shortcodes etc. are not complete. We probably need to talk through some of them to get them finalised.

Some of the mockup pages have vertical lines on the main backgrounds. These still need to be incorporated.

The Google docs forms still need to be incorporated.
